  <p align="left"> “ “Strawberry,” Rubyann said.” (136)  This story was very funny and enjoyable to read.  This story is about a Native American woman and her European fiance in a jewelry store.  Rubyann finds a turtle rattle that was made by her uncle and the fiance tries to persuade her to like the wedding ring in the jewelry store.  In the beginning of the story, the narrator gives Rubyann and her fiance some background information to give the characters depth.  When the couple encounters the white owner of the store, the white owner tries to connect with his Native American customer by saying that he is part Cherokee.  When the owner asked which tribe Rubyann belongs in, Rubyann responds back by saying, “strawberry.” (136)  This quote is funny because the owner does not say anything after her response, which means that the owner either took it as a joke or the owner believed her.  The fiance tries to persuade her to buy the wedding ring, instead of the rattle and he does not realize that the rattle is sentimental to her.   The story had humor and a little sarcasm and I very much enjoyed reading this story. </p>

  <p align="left"> This story is about a Native American veteran named Lug, who just came back from the Vietnam War and goes to a powwow.  In the beginning of the story, Lug goes to the powwow and he tries to find some familiar faces but only finds people who looks like his relatives.  The author puts Lug in this position because the author wants to distant Lug from the community and the effects of war.  Lug finds his sister and his sister invites him over to her house after the powwow.  Lug arrives to his sister's house and he reveals his experiences in Vietnam to his sister.  His sister cries and tries to endure listening to his tragic stories.  Lug despises the Purple Heart he won because he was at “the wrong place at the wrong time.” (211)  The sister tells Lug to go under a Inpatient Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder program and Lug was able to go under rehabilitation. There is a time-skip in the story and Lug is out of the program and is attending to a powwow.  He meets up with his sister and is presented with moccasins and a dance outfit.  In the end of the story, he dances with the people around him and he has a good time in the powwow.  Comparing to the beginning of the story to the end of the story, even though Lug was away from his community for a while, he was able to connect to his community in the powwow after the rehab.  Lug was able to express his feelings to his sister and in the program and that helped him cope with the horrible experiences he had in Vietnam.  Although Lug said that the spiritual man helped him more than the program, he would not be able to get through his past without his sister.  This story is an emotional story and it shows how the war affect Native Americans. </p>

  <p align="left"> This story is about a little girl with her grandmother and the Native American boarding schools.  The little girl is forced to attend school in the end of the story and the grandmother does not have the power to stop the missionaries.  In the beginning of the story, the little girl helps her grandmother by taking care of the sheep and collecting firewood.  The author gives a background to the little girl's past and the explanation of her living without her parents. The author brings up alcoholism, which is a problem in Native American society.  Her grandmother becomes the little girl's caretaker and they have a decent lifestyle.  They encounter the missionaries while picking pinions and they force the little girl to attend their school.  The little girl starts to remember her mother telling her that the Bilagaana, a white man, will take her and kill her if she is a bad child. (335)  She cries to her grandmother and asks if she was a bad child.  The missionaries explained to the grandmother that if her granddaughter does not go to school, she can be charged or go to jail.  The grandmother knew that it was impossible to stop them because they had the power to put her in jail.  The grandmother convinces her granddaughter that she has to go to school in order for her grandmother to take care of the sheep, which symbolizes strength. (336)  This story reminds me of the first movie shown in class and the story shows the struggles Native Americans had to face when every child were forced to attend school.</p>
